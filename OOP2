What is package - In Java, a package is a mechanism for organizing related classes. 
Instance variable and local variable - outside from method (java class), inside a method 

Static keyword - if class propertie or method does not rely on a object we can define as a static keyword. this is common to all class obj. 
                 if your propertie or method static access with their class name (do not access via obj - can but not standard)
                 when you change something in a variable it will reflect to all objetcs 
                 and we can not use reserved keywords like this keyword in a static method.
                 to initialized static variable you can do that via static block and this will excute only one time (when class is lodded) - and when you create another object to intialized 
                 -something it is not call. - (when the first obj create) - it is a static block that you can initialized a static variable without using a constrcutor. (NOTE:: you can also
                  do that via constrcutor)
                 -Important NOTE:: even you can call static variable via this keyword use the class name to access the static variable (when you call static variable inside a non-static method)
