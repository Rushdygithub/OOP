Private - you can access within the class (we can access it via getter but actually we are not access it directly)
Public - can access anyware (not recommended)
Default - no modifier (you can not access in dif package)
Protected - 

NOTE:: We can also extend a class from a different package 

IMPORTANT - class hyraci goes up to down which means super class does not know about thier sub class.
