What is OOP - (standard) structure or way of writing programming using class and object. 

What is a class   - bluprint or template contain with attributes/properties and method. 

Why we need class - let's think you wanna store data of students. if we get this example there are different data type will involve like stId (int) stName (String) and marks (float) etc.., here you can not store different data type 
                    within a one place using common data type like int, String and float right. so, as a solution we get classes to solve this issue. we can store different data type in a class. 

Student student = object define (data type + instance variable) - this will store in the stack and return null - this will allocate in compile time 
student = new Student() - run time 
What new keyword does - this will allocate memory in the run time and return a reference to the student variable

Student() - this is the constructor (if you do have a this method in your class this is the bydefault constructor)
