Polymorphism - it occurs during inheritance

Type of Polymorphism
Compile time or static - act of same thing in muliple ways. this can be achived  via method oveloading
method oveloading -  when class has multiple method with same name but the argument and data type can be different (multiple constructor)
compile time look which one is do i need to call (jvm)
this is not for onlt constructor work for normal method

access level - depend on the what type that we define 

reference type - detarmine which one access
object of the reference type - detarmine which one run

NOTE:: 1. You can not override a method with a final reserved keyword
       2. We can not override method if it is a static method (why because it is not depending on the object always run the function - even it is a inheritence) 
       IMPORTANT- overriden depends on object. static not depend on object hense you can not override it. (static say i do not really care about the object)
